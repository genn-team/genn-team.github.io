    <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This report presents the development of an Intel SPMD Program Compiler (ISPC) backend for GeNN (GPU-Enhanced Neuronal Networks), a code generation framework for simulating spiking neural networks . The primary goal of this project was to reduce the performance gap between single-threaded CPU implementations and GPU-accelerated simulations by exploiting the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) parallelism available in modern processors.</p>
<p>The project involved the development of a ISPC-based code generation backend within GeNN. This included kernel generation for neuron updates, synaptic processing, and custom model operations. Benchmarking and performance evaluation demonstrate that the ISPC backend achieves considerable speedups over the single-threaded CPU implementations, while retaining full compatibility with existing GeNN models. At the same time, it is easier to use and is broadly accessibly compared to GPU solutions.</p>

<h3>Introduction &amp; Need for the Project</h3>
<h4>Background on Neural Simulations and GeNN</h4>
<p><img alt="Comparison of Artificial Neural Networks and Spiking Neural Networks" src="../images/snn.jpg"><em>Figure 1: Comparison between traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), illustrating the difference in information processing and representation.</em></p>
<p>Traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), as shown in panel (a), process real-valued inputs and outputs in a series of layers. Each neuron produces a continuous activation value that is passed forward through weighted connections.</p>
<p>Panel (b) illustrates how these activations are typically represented as real numbers, such as 0.3 or 0.8, which are updated every time step during training or inference.</p>
<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs), shown in panel (c), work differently. Instead of passing continuous values, neurons communicate through discrete spikes that occur at particular points in time. Information is encoded in the timing and frequency of these spikes, making SNNs closer to how biological neurons operate. This event-driven style of computation can be much more energy efficient, since neurons are mostly idle and only update when spikes occur.</p>
<p>GeNN (GPU-enhanced Neuronal Networks) is a framework designed to accelerate simulations of spiking neural networks. It uses code generation to produce optimized kernels for different backends, such as GPUs and CPUs. This makes it possible for researchers to test large-scale SNN models efficiently, without having to write low-level code themselves.</p>
<h4>Motivation for ISPC Backend</h4>
<p>The need for an ISPC backend arises from several limitations in the existing GeNN ecosystem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware Accessibility</strong>: Not all users have access to high-end GPUs, limiting the adoption of GeNN's GPU-accelerated features. ISPC compiler is also easier to setup than CUDA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Gap</strong>: Single-threaded CPU implementations often exhibit poor performance compared to GPU versions, creating a significant dip in performance for users without GPU access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SIMD Underutilization</strong>: Modern CPUs feature powerful SIMD instruction sets (SSE, AVX, AVX-512) that remain largely untapped in traditional scalar CPU implementations. Using certain keywords in the code could give major performance boosts in computations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-Platform Portability</strong>: ISPC provides a unified programming model that can target multiple architectures (x86, ARM) and instruction sets, offering better portability than CUDA.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="ISPC SIMD Processing Model" src="../images/SIMD2.png"><em>Figure 2: ISPC's Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) execution model enables efficient utilization of CPU SIMD units by processing multiple data elements in parallel.</em></p>

<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
<h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
<p><strong>1. Understanding GeNN's Complex Architecture:</strong>
GeNN is a well-structured library with intricate code generation pipelines and backend methods. Before any implementation could begin, I invested time in studying the existing backends and their design patterns. With guidance from my mentor, I developed a clear understanding of how different components interact, which formed the foundation for all subsequent development work.</p>
<p><strong>2. Build System Integration:</strong>
Integrating ISPC compiler and build dependencies into GeNN's existing CMake-based build system was tricky. My mentor's assistance in configuring library linking and cross-platform compilation was particularly helpful in building the ISPC backend.</p>
<p><strong>3. Dual Code Generation Strategy:</strong>
ISPC keywords are not recognised in a standard C++ file and therefore the backend required managing two separate code streams - C++ host code (for .cc files) and ISPC kernel code (for .ispc files) with their respective dependencies. Initialization was managed in the C++ file while parallel computations were managed in the ISPC ones. This helped in achieving a clean code organization and optimal performance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p><strong>1. Batch Size Optimization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement support for batch sizes greater than 1 to process multiple simulation steps simultaneously</li>
<li>Leverage SIMD width more effectively by processing multiple timesteps in parallel</li>
<li>Optimize memory access patterns for batched operations to improve cache utilization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Automatic Instruction Set Detection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement runtime detection of optimal SIMD instruction set architecture (SSE, AVX, AVX2, AVX-512)</li>
<li>Automatically select the best performing instruction set based on available hardware capabilities</li>
<li>Provide fallback mechanisms for older processors while maximizing performance on newer architectures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Native ISPC Implementation of Core Functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement Random Number Generation (RNG) and other utility methods directly in ISPC</li>
<li>Reduce time spent on C++ initialization by moving more functionality to ISPC kernels</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The development of an ISPC backend for GeNN successfully addresses the performance gap between single-threaded CPU and GPU implementations. The project achieved its primary objectives by delivering a fully functional backend that provides significant performance improvements while maintaining compatibility with existing GeNN models.</p>
<h4>Key Achievements</h4>

<h4>Community Impact</h4>
<p>The ISPC backend significantly lowers the barrier to entry for high-performance neural network simulations. Researchers without access to specialized GPU hardware can now achieve considerable performance jumps for medium-scale simulations. This democratization of computational neuroscience tools aligns with GeNN's mission to make neural network simulation accessible to a broader research community.</p>
